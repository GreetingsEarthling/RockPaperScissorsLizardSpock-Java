# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock-Java

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. This quirky little game was made popular by the fictional character Sheldon Cooper in the show "The Big Bang Theory".
After wrapping up the episode in which this variant of rock paper scissors was mentioned in, I decided to test my ability to program in Java using concepts 
I was not that familiar within the coding language itself. With the help of internet articles and youtube videos, I learned how to use methods more efficiently, 
as well as learning how to create a simple GUI window with buttons in the same day within creating this project.

The rules for this game are simple, it is your typical rock paper scissors game but with an addition of two extra choices.
Below are the rules:

Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors

As you interact with the GUI's choices (whether it be rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock) the computer will also be making their own choice in the background.
Once you finish making your decision and decide to click on the button of your choice, a small window will pop up alerting you if the round resulted in a win, loss, or draw.
